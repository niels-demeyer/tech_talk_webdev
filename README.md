# tech talk webdev

This project is the result of a tech talk I did for a [BeCode](https://becode.org/). A tech talk is a presentation in the format of a TED talk on a technical concept you can choose yourself. This one is about web development and how we got to modern web frameworks.

## structure

The structure of the repo is seperated so that all the technologies have their own folder. Make sure you check out the techtalk web development.pdf file for the slides.
